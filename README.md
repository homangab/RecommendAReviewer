# Recommend-a-Reviewer
CS771 - Course Project
We tackle the problem of assigning reviewers to papers in a typical journal / conference setting. Our method builds over the [Toronto Paper Matching System](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/documents/tpms.pdf) and is described in detail in the [project report](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~amrits/RecommendReviewer_Report.pdf). We evaluate using the reviewer assignements and corresponding feedbacks in the NIPS review system.
